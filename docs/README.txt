We've accomplished a significant amount in just two days. Starting from scratch on Wednesday, we've built a complete bilingual authentication system and restructured it for maintainability.
Key accomplishments:

Created a fully functional authentication system with Firebase
Implemented seamless language switching between English and French
Built a complete user flow including registration, verification, and login
Developed a clean, responsive UI with modern design elements
Refactored the codebase for maintainability and extensibility

This solid foundation positions us well for adding more advanced features in the coming weeks. The clean architecture we've established will make it straightforward to integrate user profiles, social logins, payment processing, and other planned features.
